Welcome to the first post of the [dingh](dingh.github.io) blog. The purpose of starting this blog is to document and share some of my projects.

As recently I came across a wonderful [paper](https://r-forge.r-project.org/scm/viewvc.php/*checkout*/pkg/quantstrat/sandbox/backtest_musings/research_replication.pdf?root=blotter) written by Brian G. Peterson. The article emphasizes the importance of the pr√©cis document and systematically evaluation in the process of replicating the research of others. These are the missing pieces in my own work.

I have been working on some visualization and modeling projects. However I never spent time to document these works, which leads to a lot of waste of efforts.
Hopefully by starting this blog can help me to articulate my ideas.

Any constructive criticism is welcome.

Thanks
